mlpg-locator
============

Simple PHP script for finding a marked MLPG thread.

Files thread.php, defines.php and catalog.php contain all the needed stuff, index.php is a sample/test script.

The script uses only 4chan's inbuilt stuff (/mlp/ catalog and 4chan API). No outside sources needed!

All class members and methods are commented with phpdoc syntax so code completion should work on any PHP capable IDE (tested on NetBeans).

Go nuts (meaning: copy/edit/use/whatever as you please).
